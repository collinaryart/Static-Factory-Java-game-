# Static Factory instructions
You are playing as an Intern, hired by the intergalactic company Static factory to collect scraps from abandoned moons— scraps which are valuable for the factory’s production system. You are sent to one of the abandoned moons, “Polymorphia”, for your first mission.

You (represented by @ on the game map) start the mission inside your spaceship, and have 4 hit points (the health attribute). The spaceship is represented by several squares of floor (_) surrounded by walls (#) in the middle of the game map. You can pick up scraps to place them in your unlimited inventory, or discard them on the floor.

The moon has plants known as "Inheritrees”, the fruits of which are valuable scraps. Inheritrees start as a sapling (t), which produces small fruits (o). With their mature stage (T) comes larger fruits (O).

Scrap types:
- large bolts (+)
- metal sheets (%)


Interns can now also purchase an AI device (z), called Astley
