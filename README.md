#GAME INSTRUCTIONS

# Game Story
You are playing as the Intern, an astronaut hired by the intergalactic company Static factory to scavenge valuable scraps from abandoned moons. Your first mission takes place on the moon Polymorphia.

You (represented by @ on the game map) start the mission inside your spaceship, and have 4 Health Points. The spaceship is represented by several squares of floor (_) surrounded by walls (#) in the middle of the scrap-littered game map. You can pick up scraps to place them in your unlimited inventory, or discard them on the floor. Scraps include large bolts (+) and metal sheets (%).


# Foes
Also on the moon are several craters (u) from which enemies spawn; there are Suspicious Astronauts (ඞ) and Huntsman spiders (8), as well as the harmless, scrap-stealing Alien Bugs (a). Should the Suspicious Astronaut enter within one exit of you, you'll be killed instantly. Against other creatures, your weapons include your fists and the metal pipe (!) scrap. Also of interest are puddles of water (~) — drinking from them increases your max health. The Jar of Pickles (n) scrap, on the other hand, has a 50-50 chance of healing or harming you, depending its expiry date.


# Weapons & tech
The Pot of Gold ($) scrap, meanwhile, increases your spending power. Speaking of, you can purchase the following items from the ship's Computer Terminal:

- Astley, an AI device (z) that plays unlockable song lyrics.
- Dragon Slayer Sword (x)
- Energy Drink (*) for healing
- Toilet Paper Roll (s). It has no function.

Be warned, there's a chance the Terminal takes your money without dispensing the item, or demands double the item's price. A chance that varies according to the item.


# Flora
The moon has plants known as "Inheritrees”, which start as a sapling (t) that produces small fruits (o). With their mature stage (T) comes larger fruits (O). Fruits aren't just scraps, but also healing items.
